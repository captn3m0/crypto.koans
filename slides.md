# Setup

1.  Have a browser open with Google (Lots of googling needed for this)
2.  `git clone git@github.com/captn3m0/crypto.koans.git && cd crypto.koans`
3.  `composer install`

# <!--fit--> Koans üíÉ

---

# **koan**

_noun_, **plural ko¬∑ans, ko¬∑an.** _Zen._

1. a nonsensical or paradoxical question to a student for which an answer is demanded, the stress of meditation on the question often being illuminating.

## Ruby üíé

```
ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb

Thinking AboutAsserts
test_assert_truth has damaged your karma.

You have not yet reached enlightenment ...
<false> is not true.

Please meditate on the following code:
./about_asserts.rb:10:in `test_assert_truth'
path_to_enlightenment.rb:27

mountains are merely mountains
```

---

```ruby
 # We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via asserts.
def test_assert_truth
  assert false # This should be true
end
```

---

# tl;dr

1.  Run tests
2.  Why is the test failing? (`koans/files` directories)
3.  Get it to pass

# :whale: :one: / :two:

## As Bob

Bring up a server using your key (`1.key`) and certificate (`1.crt`) and allow any client signed
by your CA (`ca.pem`) to talk to you.

```bash
docker run --volume `pwd`/files:/etc/koans
--publish 8443:443
captn3m0/crypto.koans
```

```
# ssl_certificate /etc/koans/1.crt;
# ssl_certificate_key /etc/koans/1.key;
# ssl_client_certificate /etc/koans/ca.pem;
# Give your WiFi IP to your partner
```

---

# :whale: :two: / :two:

## As Alice

Use the certificate (signed by Bob) and the key
(which only you have) to talk to Bob's server (which
you can verify using the CA given)

```bash
curl https://server.crypto.koans.invalid:8443
--resolve server.crypto.koans.invalid:8443:192.168.1.121
--cert files/client.crt
--key files/client.key
--cacert files/bob.pem
```

```
# /etc/hosts
192.168.1.121 server.crypto.koans.invalid
```

---

# Browser üåç

1. Import `bundle.pfx` in your browser
2. Enable CA Usage for websites
3. Open https://server.crypto.koans.invalid:8443
